Welcome to my webpage! I hope you find the materials and brief discussions presented here interesting. This page is being regularly updated, so please feel free to come back soon! Also, if you have any questions or have some related or unrelated ideas or suggestions for potential collaborations, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. My contact details are in blue color below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am <b>Behrooz Ferdowsi</b>, currently a Hess Fellow and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/">Department of Geosciences, Princeton University</a>.  I am primarily working with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/rubin/">Prof. Allan M. Rubin</a> on constitutive laws for earthquake fault friction (also known as rate- and state-dependent friction laws) over the earthquake cycle, and the physics of the seismic cycle. I further collaborate with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TLJGkyYAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Troy Shinbrot</a> (Rutgers University) on several problems in granular physics, including pattern formation in granular flows. I have a long-standing interest in granular friction and granular flows, and planetary surface and subsurface processes. Before coming to Princeton, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pennsed/">Sediment Dynamics Laboratory (PennSeD)</a> and a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellow of the <a href="http://www.nced.umn.edu">National Center for Earth-Surface Dynamics (NCED)</a>. At PennSeD, I worked with <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> (UPenn, Earth and Environmental Science) on bimodal sediment transport, subsurface to surface evolution of riverbeds and also granular controls of hillslope creep and landscape evolution. I also worked with my NCED-synthesis postdoctoral team (a team of highly motivated early career Earth scientists) to develop what we call an Earthcasting framework that we hope will shape the future of applied and fundamental research in Earth-surface sciences. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received my PhD (Dr. sc.) from <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> (Switzerland) under supervision of <a href="http://www.carmeliet.ethz.ch">Prof. Jan Carmeliet</a> and <a href="http://www.calcolodistr.altervista.org/en/index_en.html">Dr. Michele Griffa</a> and in collaboration with <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/ees/ees11/geophysics/staff/johnson/johnson.shtml">Dr. Paul Johnson</a> (Los Alamos National Laboratory) and <a href="http://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/marone-chris">Prof. Chris Marone</a> (Pennsylvania State University). For my PhD, I studied Dynamic Earthquake Triggering phenomenon, that is triggering of earthquakes by other (seismic) sources.

<h2><div class="large">Research interests</div></h2>

I have a broad research interest in several (and expanding) areas of geosciences and geophysics, including (i) constitutive laws for earthquake fault friction over the earthquake cycle, fault zone processes, and the physics of the seismic cycle, (ii) hillslope and landscape evolution, geohazards and their environmental implications, (iii) fluvial geomorphology and aeolian transport, and (iv) sedimentology. I am further excited about ways that geomorphic and seismic observations can complement each other, and help with a better understanding of Earth-surface and subsurface processes in isolation and in coupling. I am also interested in broad engineering applications and implications of these research areas including implementation of the latest scientific discoveries in hazard assessment and mitigation. The unifying concept of my research and scientific interests <i>however</i> lies in soft condensed matter physics and the statistical physics of particles and fields. I search for laws (preferrably universal but they could be also non-universal) that can describe spatiotemporal evolution of different sections (and cross-sections) of the Earth and other planets across the scales of time (sub-second to million years) and length (asperities and grains to geo/log/phy/ical scales). For my works, I often use a combination of laboratory-scale experiments, numerical (Discrete Element Method and Molecular Dynamics) simulations, and analytical (sometimes continuum) modeling, with continuous inspiration and insight from direct (by myself) and indirect (previously published, collected, documented) field observations.

<h3><i><div class="normalsize">a) Evolution of riverbed surface in gravel-bed rivers (2015-2017)</div></i></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In collaboration with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=s0qqJ7IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Carlos P. Ortiz</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/houssaismorgane/">Dr. Morgane Houssais</a> and under direction of <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a>, I worked on sediment transport in bimodal (two major grain size) systems in an idealized laboratory river. Separation or segregation of grains with different size (and shape, mass, surface characteristics, etc.) is a frequently observed phenomenon in rivers, streams (where it is commonly known as sorting, coarsening, or armoring when larger grains cover the riverbed surface, and is known as gravel bars and fans when segregation and separation takes place intermittently) and all forms of granular materials and systems! Geologists and geomorphologists tend to think that formation of a coarse surface layer shields the finer underlying grains from erosion. They also traditionally assume that armor develops due to sorting of surficial grains by the fluid flow. In this research, we showed how motion of grains deep beneath the surface delivers larger grains to the surface. Using experiments in a laboratory river, and discrete and continuum models, we further demonstrated that river-bed armoring is driven by vertical granular segregation and that the fluid has little effect. Results also revealed different segregation mechanisms for deep (creeping) versus shallow (dense and rapidly flowing) grains, which has broader implications for all manner of granular flows. Please see our  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01681-3">Nature Communications (2017)</a> paper and  <a href="https://news.upenn.edu/news/brazil-nut-effect-helps-explain-how-rivers-resist-erosion-penn-team-finds">University of Pennsylvania News article: `Brazil Nut Effect` Helps Explain How Rivers Resist Erosion </a> on this work for more information.

The brighter continuous lines are predictions from a modified version -to account for creep (slow flow) segregation- of <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~ngray/Papers/JFM_550_2006.pdf">advection-diffusion model</a> [<a href="#gray2015particlesizedensity" id="CITEgray2015particlesizedensity" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Gray and Ancey, [2015]</a>,<a href="#gray2005theory" id="CITEgray2005theory" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Gray and Thornton, [2005]</a>], , commonly used to model size-segregation phenomenon in granular mixing. Note the first rapid stage of armoring, which is dependent on Shields number and is associated with bed-load transport, and the second slower stage that exhibits a nearly constant rate for all Shields numbers and is the result of creep.

<h3><i><div class="normalsize">b) Hillslope evolution and landscape dynamics over geological timescales (2016-present)</div></i></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Soil creeps imperceptibly downhill, but also fails catastrophically to create landslides. Despite the importance of these processes as hazards and in sculpting landscapes, there is no agreed upon model that captures the full range of behavior. In this work, we have examined the granular origins of hillslope soil transport by Discrete Element Method simulations, studying deformation and transport in an experimental hillslope using dynamic light scattering technique,  and re-analysis of sediment flux versus gradient measurements in natural landscapes around the world. We found creep for slopes below a critical gradient, where average particle velocity (sediment flux) increases exponentially with friction coefficient (gradient). At critical there is a continuous transition to a dense-granular flow rheology, consistent with previous laboratory experiments and theoretical developments in amorphous Earth materials and disordered media [<a href="#fisher1998collective" id="CITEfisher1998collective" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Fisher, 1998</a>,<a href="#chauve2000creep" id="CITEchauve2000creep" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Chauve et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>,<a href="#dauchot2005dynamical" id="CITEdauchot2005dynamical" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Dauchot et&nbsp;al., 2005</a>,<a href="#reddy2011evidence" id="CITEreddy2011evidence" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Reddy et&nbsp;al., 2011</a>,<a href="#reichhardt2016depinning" id="CITEreichhardt2016depinning" class="tth_citation">&nbsp;Reichhardt and Reichhardt, 2016</a>]. Slow earthflows and landslides thus exhibit glassy dynamics that is a characteristic of a wide range of disordered materials; they are described by a two-phase flux equation that emerges from grain-scale friction alone. This glassy model reproduces topographic profiles of natural hillslopes, showing its promise for predicting hillslope evolution over geologic timescales.

Numerical simulations of earthquake nucleation rely on constitutive rate and state evolution laws to model earthquake initiation and propagation processes. In these laws, the frictional response of an interface is described as:

In equations (2) and (3), D<sub>c</sub> is a characteristic slip distance. The "state" variable &#952; is designed so as  to reflect the product of the true contact area of asperities of the frictional interface and the intrinsic strength of the contacts in touch.

<div class="small">&#8593; (A) Most empirical frictional laws deal with the evolution of frictional resistance between two solid blocks pressed together and pulled (sometimes with a spring attached to one of the blocks) at a constant velocity or force parallel to solid-solid interface. The effective contact between the two interface is made of small localized patches whose total area is significantly less that the nominal area of contact. (B) The actual fault-fault interface is usually comprised of weak and fragmented rocks called "fault gouge". The rate- and state-dependent friction laws are supposedly designed to work for both solid-solid interface friction and the granular-interface friction. Despite decades of rigorous experimental, numerical, computational, observational and theoretical research by a broad group of researchers from geophysics to physics and tribology, the fundamental physics of frictional interfaces (including for fault physics) remain illusive for both types of interfaces until nowadays. The image is the courtesy of Kristie Bradford, http://geology1403.blogspot.com. (C) The figure shows the transient ("direct") and (toward "evolution") steady-state effect on friction of a change in loading velocity for a 3-mm–thick layer of quartz gouge sheared under nominally dry conditions at 25-MPa normal stress [<a href="#marone1998laboratory" id="CITEmarone1998laboratory" class="tth_citation">Marone, 1998</a>]. (D) The figure shows the behavior of velocity-step experiments (four order of magnitude velocity change compared to the initial imposed velocity) on a simulated granular layer, subject to confining pressure 5-MPa. The Hertzian normal contact law and Coulomb friction law govern the grain-grain contact interactions, and the mean grain diameter is 3 mm (polydisperse grain size distribution). Note that no time-dependent plasticity is implemented at the grain contact scale. One of our goals in this research program is to separate complex though important contributions of contact plasticity, then design a granular-physics based friction law for fault and Earth materials friction. We will next revisit the problem and contributions of contact plasticity on frictional behavior as related to wide range of geoscience problems including earthquake source and physics in collaboration with physicists, geophysicists, and tribologists.

The response of different state evolution laws to large velocity increases is an important feature of these constitutive relations that can significantly change the style of earthquake nucleation in numerical models. However, currently there is not a rigorous understanding of the physical origins of the response of bare rock or gouge-filled fault zones to large velocity increases. This in turn hinders our ability to design physics-based friction laws that can appropriately describe those responses. In this research program, we argue that most fault zones form a granular gouge after an initial shearing phase and that it is the behavior of the gouge layer that controls the fault friction. We perform numerical experiments of a confined sheared granular gouge under a range of confining stresses and driving velocities relevant to fault zones and apply 1-3 order of magnitude velocity steps to explore dynamical behavior of the system from grain- to macro-scales. We compare our numerical observations with experimental data from biaxial double-direct-shear fault gouge experiments under equivalent loading and driving conditions. Our intention is to first investigate the degree to which these numerical experiments, with Hertzian normal and Coulomb friction laws at the grain-grain contact scale and without any time-dependent plasticity, can reproduce experimental fault gouge behavior. We next compare the behavior observed in numerical experiments with predictions of the Dieterich (Aging) and Ruina (Slip) friction laws. Ultimately, the numerical observations at the grain and meso-scales will be used for designing a rate and state evolution law that takes into account recent advances in rheology of granular systems, including local and non-local effects [<a href="#DeGiuli15082017" id="CITEDeGiuli15082017" class="tth_citation">DeGiuli and Wyart, 2017</a>,<a href="#zhang2017microscopic" id="CITEzhang2017microscopic" class="tth_citation">Zhang and Kamrin, 2017</a>,<a href="#henann2013predictive" id="CITEhenann2013predictive" class="tth_citation">Henann and Kamrin, 2013</a>], for a wide range of shear rates and slow and fast deformation regimes of the fault gouge.
